## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/phstudy/turing_screen_cli.git
   cd turing_screen_cli
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional, for development) Install in editable mode:
   ```sh
   pip install -e .
   ```

4. Make sure FFmpeg is installed on your system (required for video functionality).

## Usage

After installation, you can use the CLI as follows:

```sh
turing-screen [command] [options]
```

### Available Commands

#### Image Operations

  ```

#### Video Operations
- **Play a video on the screen**
  ```sh
  turing-screen video /path/to/video.mp4
  ```
- **Loop the video**
  ```sh
  turing-screen video /path/to/video.mp4 --loop
  ```
- **Stop video playback**
  ```sh
  turing-screen video /path/to/video.mp4 --stop
  ```

#### File Operations
- **Upload a file to device storage**
  ```sh
  turing-screen file upload /path/to/file.png
  ```
- **Delete a file from device storage**
  ```sh
  turing-screen file delete filename.png
  ```
- **List files in device storage**
  ```sh
  turing-screen file list /path/on/device
  ```

#### Device Operations
- **Send sync command**
  ```sh
  turing-screen device sync
  ```
- **Restart the device**
  ```sh
  turing-screen device restart
  ```
- **Set screen brightness (0-102)**
  ```sh
  turing-screen device brightness 50
  ```
- **Set frame rate**
  ```sh
  turing-screen device frame-rate 30

## Device Storage Structure

The Turing Smart Screen has the following storage structure:
- Images are stored in: `/tmp/sdcard/mmcblk0p1/img/`
- Videos are stored in: `/tmp/sdcard/mmcblk0p1/video/`

## Image and Video Requirements

- Images:
  - Format: PNG only
  - Resolution: 480x1920 pixels
- Videos:
  - For direct streaming: MP4 format (will be converted to H264)
  - For storage: H264 format

## Development & Testing

- **Run tests:**
  ```sh
  pytest
  ```
- **Type checking:**
  ```sh
  mypy src/turing_screen_cli
  ```
- **Code formatting:**
  ```sh
  black src/turing_screen_cli
  ```
- **Linting:**
  ```sh
  flake8 src/turing_screen_cli
  ```

## Troubleshooting

- If you get "USB device not found" error, make sure the device is properly connected
- For permission issues on Linux, try running with sudo or configure udev rules
  - Linux users may need to detach the kernel driver using `dev.detach_kernel_driver(0)`
- Make sure FFmpeg is installed and in your system PATH for video functionality
- For video playback issues, ensure the video has been properly converted to H264 format
